    - text: "We grind our own burger daily, it is fresh brisket, inside round and ribeye to make a fantastic burger. Burgers are the focal point but do not miss our ground chicken burger and is all white meat and zucchini for a healthy option. We hand cut our fries daily and make shakes the old fashioned way."
